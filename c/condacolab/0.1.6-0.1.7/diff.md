 ## FAQ
 
 ### How does it work?
 
-Google Colab runs on Python 3.9. We install the Miniconda distribution on top of the existing one at `/usr/local`, add a few configuration files so we stay with Python 3.9 and the newly installed packages are available. Finally, we wrap the Python executable to redirect and inject some environment variables needed to load the new libraries. Since we need to re-read `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, a kernel restart is needed.

 ### How can I cache my installation? I don't want to wait every time I start Colab.
 
 The recommended approach is to build your own `constructor`-based installer. We have provided an example in `constructor-example/construct.yaml`.
 
 > You can generate a `constructor` installer on Colab too! Follow [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jaimergp/condacolab/blob/main/constructor-example/condacolab_constructor_tutorial.ipynb).

 ## Can I install R packages?
 
 Yes, as long as you make sure you also install `rpy2` to overwrite Colab's installation.

We install the Miniconda distribution on top of the existing one at `/usr/local`, add a few configuration files so we stay with Python 3.9 and the newly installed packages are available. Finally, we wrap the Python executable to redirect and inject some environment variables needed to load the new libraries. Since we need to re-read `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, a kernel restart is needed.

 ### How can I cache my installation? I don't want to wait every time I start Colab.
 
 The recommended approach is to build your own `constructor`-based installer. We have provided an example in `constructor-example/construct.yaml`.

 ## Can I install R packages?
 
 Yes, as long as you make sure you also install `rpy2` to overwrite Colab's installation.
